Spoon
-----

Spoon is a quick feedback system based on the big ones,
to help you get started with your new project, and start collecting
user feedback right away.

Go check out the [Spoon website](https://spoon.christiansandor.com)

Get started
-----------
You need to download the `spoon.js` file in the `dist` folder,
and paste it as a script tag before the `</body>` tag as
```
<script src="spoon.js"></script>
```

You can also find the file in this URL:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/christiansandor/spoon/master/dist/spoon.js


### Work with callbacks
```
<script>
    new Spoon({
        callback: function (obj) {
            console.log(obj);
        }
    });
</script>
```

### Work with callback URLs
```
<script>
    new Spoon({
        callbackUrl: '/api/feedback'
    });
</script>
```

In both cases the object you'll receive will be based on this interface
```
CallbackObject {
    name: string;
    email: string;
    message: string;
    reminder_clicked: boolean;
    reminder_shown: boolean;
    url: string;
}
```
